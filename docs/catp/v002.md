# CATP (Computer algebra transfer protocol) v0.0.1

## Packet structure

CATP packet consists of two parts: header (first 4 bytes of packet) and content (all the bytes after the first 4).

### Header

First byte of the packet corresponds to the type of packet. There are three possible modes:

| Packet type            | Corresponding first byte of header | Description                                                  |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Computational request  |                 0                  | Packet of this type contains information on which computations should be performed and object on which they should be performed |
| Computational response |                 1                  | Packet of this type contains response to computational request in form of object - result of operation performed or error message |
| Progress packet        |                 2                  | Contains information about progress of the last computational request |

Second byte contains length of content in bytes for the ease of parsing and decoding packet as well as informational purposes.

Third byte contains information about mode of the packet. Mode is basically type of computations which will be performed/in progress/done. Modes we have in this version of protocol are specific to SymbServer and can be remade to be relevant for other computer algebra client-server applications. In this version there are 4 modes:

|  Packet mode   | Corresponding second byte of header | Description                                                  |
| :------------: | :---------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|   derivative   |                  0                  | Computation of derivative or partial derivative of any order of specific function |
|  def_integral  |                  1                  | Computation of definite integral on the interval of function |
| indef_integral |                  2                  | Computation of indefinite integral of function               |
|    simplify    |                  3                  | Simplification of expression                                 |

Fourth byte can contain only 2 values: 0 and 1.  0 corresponds to success, 1 - to error. These byte is mostly used in computational response type of packets to mark successful and unsuccessful operations.

### Content

As a standard ASCII should be used to encode and decode content part of packet. 

Content of the packet depends on type and mode of request:

| Packet type            | Packet mode    | Content form                 | Remarks                                                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Computational request  | derivative     | function\|derivative order   | Derivative order consists of variables names divided by vertical bar symbol. E.g. to find second order derivative of function with respect to **x** variable derivative order should look like this: **x\|x** |
| Computational request  | def_integral   | function\|variable\|interval | Integration interval should contain two numbers or expressions which can be calculated to numbers divided by space (' ') e.g. **pi 2\*pi** |
| Computational request  | indef_integral | function\|variable           | Content has the same structure as in def_integral mode but without the interval |
| Computational request  | simplify       | expression                   | No need of any special symbols, just expression you want to simplify |
| Computational response | Any            | result                       | Content will contain result of computation. It can be either resulting object or error message. |
| Progress packet        | Any            | progress string              | Content basically has encoded string with information about progress of operation |

Vertical bar symbol (|, ASCII code 124) is widely used in content part of packet to split different parts of content.
