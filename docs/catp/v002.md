# CATP (Computer algebra transfer protocol) v0.0.2

## Packet structure

CATP packet consists of two parts: header (first 3 bytes of packet) and content (all the bytes after the first 3).

Every packet should end with `<CR><LF><CR><LF>`  (`<CR>` - carriage return, ASCII 13; `<LF>` - line feed, ASCII 10).

### Header

First byte of the packet corresponds to the type of packet. There are three possible modes:

| Packet type            | Corresponding first byte of header | Description                                                  |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Computational request  |                 0                  | Packet of this type contains information on which computations should be performed and object on which they should be performed |
| Computational response |                 1                  | Packet of this type contains response to computational request in form of object - result of operation performed or error message |
| Progress packet        |                 2                  | Contains information about progress of the last computational request |
| Login request          |                 3                  | Contains login and password for login attempt                |
| Login response         |                 4                  | Contains information about whether login was successful or not |
| Registration request   |                 5                  | Contains login and password for registration attempt         |
| Registration response  |                 6                  | Contains information about whether registration was successful or not |
| History request        |                 7                  | Requests history of computations of specific user            |
| History response       |                 8                  | Contains all the computations requested by user              |

Second byte contains information about mode of the packet. Mode is basically type of computations which will be performed/in progress/done. Modes we have in this version of protocol are specific to SymbServer and can be remade to be relevant for other computer algebra client-server applications. In this version there are 4 modes:<CR><LF>

|  Packet mode   | Corresponding second byte of header | Description                                                  |
| :------------: | :---------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|   derivative   |                  0                  | Computation of derivative or partial derivative of any order of specific function |
|  def_integral  |                  1                  | Computation of definite integral on the interval of function |
| indef_integral |                  2                  | Computation of indefinite integral of function               |
|    simplify    |                  3                  | Simplification of expression                                 |
|  unspecified   |                  4                  | Used in packets where mode is not specified (login, registration, history) |

> Note: packet mode for packet type 3 to 8 should always be 'unspecified' (mode 4).

Third byte can contain only 2 values: 0 and 1.  0 corresponds to success, 1 - to error. This byte is mostly used in computational response type of packets to mark successful and unsuccessful operations; comparing to v0.0.1, this byte is also used in login, registration and history response.

> Types 0, 2, 3, 5, 7 have third byte as 0 ("success") by default
### Content

As a standard ASCII should be used to encode and decode content part of packet. 

Content of the packet depends on type and mode of request:

| Packet type            | Packet mode    | Content form                                                 | Remarks                                                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Computational request  | derivative     | function\|derivative order                                   | Derivative order consists of variables names divided by vertical bar symbol. E.g. to find second order derivative of function with respect to **x** variable derivative order should look like this: **x\|x** |
| Computational request  | def_integral   | function\|variable\|interval                                 | Integration interval should contain two numbers or expressions which can be calculated to numbers divided by space (' ') e.g. **pi 2\*pi** |
| Computational request  | indef_integral | function\|variable                                           | Content has the same structure as in def_integral mode but without the interval |
| Computational request  | simplify       | expression                                                   | No need of any special symbols, just expression you want to simplify |
| Computational response | Any            | result                                                       | Content will contain result of computation. It can be either resulting object or error message.<CR><LF><CR><LF> |
| Progress packet        | Any            | progress string                                              | Content basically has encoded string with information about progress of operation |
| Login request          | unspecified    | nickname`<CR><LF>`password                                           | Nickname is arbitrary string, password is hashed (in SymbServer - using bcryprt). |
| Login response         | unspecified    | empty or error description                                   | All the information needed contains in third byte.           |
| Registration request   | unspecified    | nickname`<CR><LF>`password                                           | Nickname is arbitrary string, password is hashed (in SymbServer - using bcryprt). |
| Registration response  | unspecified    | empty or error description                                   | All the information needed contains in third byte.           |
| History request        | unspecified    | empty                                                        | Client should be logged in to request history.               |
| History response       | unspecified    | Error text or history string as many times as there are records in history | Each record should be separated with `<CR><LF>`.               |

Vertical bar symbol (|, ASCII code 124) is widely used in content part of packet to split different parts of content.
